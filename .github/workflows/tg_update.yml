#
# Workflow Name: Update channel
#
# Description:
#   This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered when a pull request is closed on the `master` branch.
#   If the pull request is merged, the workflow looks for the first `.md` file in the merge commit,
#   and sends its content as a Markdown-formatted message to a specified Telegram channel using a bot.
#
# Use Case:
#   Automatically notify your Telegram channel about changes (e.g. changelog, documentation) when PRs
#   are merged into `master`.
#
# Trigger:
#   - Event: pull_request
#   - Types: [closed]
#   - Branch: master
#   - Conditional: only runs if PR is merged (not just closed)
#
# Required Secrets:
#   - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: Token from @BotFather to send messages via Telegram Bot API
#   - TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID: Telegram channel ID or @username where the message will be sent
#
# Assumptions:
#   - At least one Markdown file (.md) is modified in the merge commit.
#   - The file's contents are under Telegramâ€™s 4096 character message limit.
#
# Limitations:
#   - Only the first `.md` file found in the commit is sent.
#   - The workflow does not handle oversized content (multi-message support can be added later).
